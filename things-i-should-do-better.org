#+TITLE: Things I Should Do Better

* Spend 7-10 days on rust language exercises
rust-quiz have too many extreme tricks on Rustlang itself,
which are not very useful for solving rCore-tutorial labs,
not a good spend of time in a time-limited camp.

* Make good use of debugging tools
A good debugging tool boosts productivity and reduces frustration when
reading documentation and code reference framework.
The gdb tutorial in rCore documentation didn't help to make it work, spend
too much time re-reading code rather than debugging through a simple example.

* good/bad
Focusing on details irrelevant to problems(lab) too much hurts progression.
